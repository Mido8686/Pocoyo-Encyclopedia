## How to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues
If you find:
- Incorrect information  
- Missing pages  
- Formatting problems  
- Broken links or missing images  
- Spelling or grammar mistakes  

Please **create a GitHub Issue** instead of editing directly.  
Issues help us track what needs fixing and let others discuss solutions.

Go to the repository’s **“Issues”** tab and click **“New Issue.”**  
Be sure to include:
- A short, clear title (e.g. “Typo in Elly character page”)  
- A description of what’s wrong or missing  
- (Optional) Screenshots or example text

### 2. Suggest New Pages or Ideas
If you have an idea for:
- A new section or category  
- A redesign of structure (like better navigation)  
- A fan observation or trivia addition  

Open a **Feature Request Issue** to share your idea before creating new files.  
This helps keep the wiki consistent and organized.
